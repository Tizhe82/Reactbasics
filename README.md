# Reactbasics
I started a react project called cryptoverse but i was having issues so i decided to go and learn basics of react and guess what it was worth 
I learnt about reusable Components  hooks and Properties basic ES6 modules 
The project i build was a small booklist more of a sketch it does not have much but has basics of react 
to start the project 
run npm install to intall the necessary dependencies on your local machine 
run npm start to start local server on your local machine
